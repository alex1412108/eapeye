calibration test was performed with 1 V sent to the front voltage box and 0 V sent to the back voltage box.
test was started with both boxes previously set to 0 V. At the conclusion of the test both boxes were set to 0 V.
the format for data is (bottompotential, bottomcurrent, voltageboxfront, toppotential, topcurrent, voltageboxback, load cell, displacement laser) 

for 'both vin' and 'both boxes'
Load cell control box reads 1.949 to 1.952
displacement laser control box reads -0.0016 to -0.0054

for 'both boxes'
Load cell control box reads 1.949 to 1.950
displacement laser control box reads -0.1585 to -0.1606

'both vin' refers to reading both of the voltages from the hv boxes
'both boxes' refers to using both galvanostats, applying 1 V to the top box and 0 V to the other and then swapping.
'both boxes' should be examined with the others present as backups.
